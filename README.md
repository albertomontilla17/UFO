# UFOs

## Overview

•    The purpose of the challenge was to create a web page that let Dana’s users to filter data on UFO sightings based on state, city, type of sighting, and date.


### Results

•    When using the filters to filter the data on the UFO sightings, you can filter by City, State, Country, and Type of Sighting. 

•    If you filter on state, for example California, you will enter “ca” in the search state search bar and the results will show all of the sightings in the state of California:

•    If you want to filter by shape, you can search for “triangle” and the results will show all of the date in all states and cities that had a triangle sighting:

•    You can also search through the data by using multiple filters:

### Summary

•    The filters allow the users to search through the data by date, city, state, country, and type of sighting but the draw back of doing this is that based on the filter you search for, it can bring back a lot of data to look through. I would recommend to add to the website is, if the sighting has any videos or pictures from it, we can add a link to it that would allow the users to go view them. We could also add a live chat that would allow the users to talk to each other and have discussions if the sighting is a hoax or not.
